This project uses TensorFlow to build a deep learning model that predicts if a nonprofit will use its funding successfully.
I cleaned and prepared the data using Pandas and Scikit learn, turning categories into numbers and scaling the values.
I made two models one simple and one improved with more layers and saved both as .h5 files.
The second model worked better because I added more layers and neurons to help it learn more from the data.
